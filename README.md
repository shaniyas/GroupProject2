## Data Set Description
The U.S. Food Imports data product is an annually published statistical summary of the value and volume of food imports coming into the United States.
U.S. consumers demand variety, quality, and convenience in the foods they consume. As U.S. consumers have become wealthier and more ethnically diverse, their food basket reflects a growing share of tropical products, spices, and imported gourmet products.
This data set provides import values of edible products (food and beverages) entering U.S. ports and the products’ origin of shipment. The data comes from the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census. The dataset includes 7 columns. The columns for category, commodity, subcategory, UOM (unit of measurement), and country are all string types, with country also having a geographic role. The columns for food value and year are numbers. Food and beverage import values are compiled by calendar year into food groups, corresponding to major commodities or level of processing. The Harmonized System (HS) codes and the corresponding commodities and food products are detailed in the data file. 25 years of annual data are included, enabling users to track long-term growth patterns.

## Question 1: Which regions export which commodities to the US?

**Data Manipulation:** 
The data included 61 countries. In order to put countries into their respective regions, we used a CASE WHEN statement in a calculated field, Region. For example, "CASE WHEN 'Canada' THEN 'North America'". We also filtered out the countries that were uncategorized into a region (I.e. "Rest of World"). 

**Implications of Question 1:**
The implications of Question 2 highlight two major themes. First, there is clear regional specialization in food production across the world. Different regions focus on specific categories: South America is known for fruits and coffee, Asia specializes in grains, fish, and nuts, while Europe is prominent in beverages, dairy, and cocoa. Understanding these specialization patterns can help optimize trade partnerships and supply chain logistics by leveraging regional strengths. Second, the U.S. food system shows a strong dependency on global markets. Many products, such as vegetables, meats, and spices, are sourced internationally. This reliance means that disruptions in specific regions—whether from conflict, policy changes, or climate events—can significantly impact certain sectors of the U.S. food supply.

**How the data can be used:**
Policymakers can leverage these insights to identify critical supply chains and prioritize the development of strategic trade agreements or diversification initiatives. A thorough understanding of import concentration can also enhance efforts to monitor and mitigate food security risks. Importers and retailers may focus on strengthening supplier relationships in key production regions and utilize historical trends to forecast demand and optimize seasonal inventory planning. Additionally, researchers and economists can examine long-term shifts in U.S. food consumption patterns and investigate the correlations between cultural demographic changes and the growth of food imports.


## Question 2: How have imports changed in the last 20 years?

**Data Manipulation:** 
There were some uncategorized country fields: “World”, “World (quantity)”, and “Rest of World” that were filtered out. We also created a calculated field to change the food value from millions to billions, for clarity.

**Implications of Question 2:**
Since 1999, food imports have steadily increased around the world. Canada’s imports, in particular, have grown sharply, showing greater demand and reliance on foreign supply. Similarly, countries like China, India, and Brazil are importing more as their incomes rise and diets change. However, this growing dependence on imports makes countries more vulnerable to disruptions. Trade restrictions, climate events, and conflicts can quickly threaten food security. Because of the interconnectedness of global supply chains, a crisis in one region can have ripple effects across many others.



**How the data can be used:** 
This data can be used by different groups to make informed decisions. Policymakers can track the growing dependence on imports to improve national food security planning and prepare for future supply chain disruptions by identifying high-risk regions or overreliance on certain trade partners. Importers and retailers can adjust their sourcing strategies to lower risks from concentrated suppliers and use trends in import growth to better manage inventory and respond to changing consumer demand. Researchers and economists can study how economic growth relates to food import expansion across regions and assess how global trade policies and environmental events influence long-term import patterns.
